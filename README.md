# GreenerLiving
Simple steps to greener living, sorted by area.

## Kitchen
* Sponges: replace with combination of [resusable dish towels](https://www.amazon.com/]/dp/B07G376745), and [steel scrubbers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002CQTXBC). You'll find that the steel scrubbers work better on stainless and cast iron than normal scruffie pads on sponges. 
* Paper towels: replace with a set of [kitchen towels](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016RYYBDE). Not only do these save you $$ by eliminating expensive paper towels, you'll find they are far more absorbent once washed once or twice.
