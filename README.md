# GreenerLiving
Simple steps to greener living, sorted by area. We use the following criteria to determine whether recommendations are suitable:
1. Is it better for the environment?
2. Is it convenient for you?
3. Is it good for your wallet?

If a product doesn't meet criteria #1, it can't appear in Greener Living. If the product meets criteria #1, then we measure convenience and cost savings against the bar of the encumbent it is replacing using a simpler lowers, meets, raises, like this:
|             	| Lowers 	| Meets 	| Raises 	|
|-------------	|--------	|-------	|--------	|
| Convenience 	|        	|       	|   x     |
| Cost        	|        	|       	|   x    	|

## Kitchen

### Sponges
Replace with combination of [resusable dish towels](https://www.amazon.com/]/dp/B07G376745), and [steel scrubbers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002CQTXBC). The steel scrubbers work better on stainless and cast iron than normal scruffie pads on sponges.

| Convenience 	|        	|   x    	|         |
| Cost        	|        	|   x    	|        	|


### Paper towels
Replace with a set of [kitchen towels](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016RYYBDE). Not only do these save $$$ by eliminating paper towels, you'll find they are far more absorbent once washed once or twice, making it quicker to clean up messes around the house.

| Convenience 	|        	|       	|   x     |
| Cost        	|        	|       	|   x     |

## Living Areas

### Rugs
Get a [cotton rug](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GRZB442) instead of polyester or polypropylene rugs. Besides eliminating a common source of plastic in your house, you can fit reasonably sized cotton rugs (like that 6'x9') into most washing machines, making them a breeze to wash if you have children or pets. Like most cotton, including clothing made from cotton, there's a chance that pesticides were used on the cotton in cotton rugs. The washer may be an effective way to remove any residue, but it hasn't been studied enough to conclude it's safe. If you want to go even further than cotton, you can look into a [rug made from jute](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SWW1K1G), a [natural fiber](https://www.contrado.com/blog/what-is-jute).
